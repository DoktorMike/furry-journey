# furry-journey

The goal of furry-journey is to enable users to see how simple Bayesian modeling can be when done from the beginning withouth the magic of frequentists magical equations.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
